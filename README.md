# Fourier Series Visualizer

## Description

This project is an interactive visualization of Fourier series using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It allows users to create and combine multiple waves by adjusting their frequency and amplitude, helping to illustrate how complex waveforms can be represented as the sum of simpler sine waves.

## Features

- **Dynamic Wave Creation**: Users can input different frequencies and amplitudes for individual sine waves.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: As users adjust the parameters, the graphs update instantly to reflect the changes.
- **Wave Combination**: Visualize the result of combining multiple sine waves into a single waveform.
- **Save Graphs**: Users can save the resulting graphs as images for further analysis or presentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
